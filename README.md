# instance_nearest_ext for GMS

**Instance_nearest_ext** is an extension for Game Maker 8.
This is a port of that legacy extension to Game Maker Studio 1 & 2. <br>

**The extension allows you to do several things:**
<ul> 
<li>Find the Nth nearest instance</li>
<li>Find the Nth furthest instance</li>
<li>Find Nth nearest instance with variable X = 0, where "X" can be any variable, "0" can be any number and "=" can be any operator.</li>
</ul>

The original extension that I based this off was written by **Kyle_Solo** can can be found here: http://gmbase.cubedwater.com/index.php?page=extension&id=158
